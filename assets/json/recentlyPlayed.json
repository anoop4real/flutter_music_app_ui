And he should know, since he basically invented the genre three years earlier with his album Discreet Music. But while Eno\u2019s definition of ambient has been cited continuously in the decades since, the sphere of music he first defined has broadened, especially if you judge by how that word is used by listeners. \u201cAmbient\u201d is now used to describe all kinds of music, from tracks you can dance to all the way to harsh noise. For our exploration of the greatest ambient albums, we polled critics for their favorites, with the suggestion that \u201cambient\u201d meant, in part, music that creates an environment, something like a cloud of sound, be it soothing, sad, haunting, or ominous. We also suggested that our take on ambient music shies away from heavy rhythms and tends more toward \u201cdrifting\u201d than \u201cdriving,\u201d which meant de-emphasizing ambient house. And we considered the fact that not all albums in a given artist\u2019s catalogue qualify as ambient. Taking into account our writers\u2019 interpretation of those loose guidelines, here\u2019s our list of the 50 best ambient albums.
